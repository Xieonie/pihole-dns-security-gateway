# Pi-hole and Cloudflared Docker Environment Variables Example
# Copy this file to .env and customize the values.

# --- Pi-hole Settings ---
# Timezone for the container (e.g., Europe/Berlin, America/New_York)
# See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
TZ=Etc/UTC

# Password for the Pi-hole web admin interface.
# SET A STRONG PASSWORD HERE! If left empty or weak, it's a security risk.
WEBPASSWORD=your_very_secure_pihole_password

# Host port for the Pi-hole web admin interface.
# If port 80 on your host is taken, change this (e.g., 8080).
# This value will be used in docker-compose.yml for port mapping.
PIHOLE_WEB_PORT=80

# Optional: Set a specific IPv4 address for the Pi-hole container within the Docker network.
# This needs to be within the DOCKER_NETWORK_SUBNET defined below.
PIHOLE_IPV4_ADDRESS=172.20.0.2

# FTL (Faster Than Light - Pi-hole's DNS/DHCP server) Configuration
# Hostname of the Pi-hole machine, as seen by clients.
# If your Pi-hole host has IP 192.168.1.10, set this to 192.168.1.10
# This is important if Pi-hole also serves DHCP.
# If Pi-hole is only DNS, this isn't as critical but good to set.
# FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4=192.168.1.10 # Replace with your Pi-hole host's LAN IP

# Upstream DNS servers for Pi-hole.
# When using the cloudflared service in the docker-compose.yml,
# these should point to the cloudflared container's IP and port.
# The IP must match CLOUDFLARED_IPV4_ADDRESS.
DNS1=172.20.0.3#5053
DNS2= # Optional second DoH proxy or leave blank

# Optional: Interface listening behavior for dnsmasq (Pi-hole's embedded DNS server)
# listen-address=127.0.0.1 # Listen only on localhost (if Pi-hole itself is behind another proxy)
# interface=eth0 # Listen on a specific interface
# By default, Pi-hole listens on all interfaces.
# For Docker, it typically listens on the container's IP.

# --- Cloudflared Settings (if using the cloudflared service from docker-compose.yml) ---
# Optional: Set a specific IPv4 address for the cloudflared container within the Docker network.
CLOUDFLARED_IPV4_ADDRESS=172.20.0.3

# --- Docker Network Settings ---
# Define the subnet for the custom Docker bridge network.
# Ensure PIHOLE_IPV4_ADDRESS and CLOUDFLARED_IPV4_ADDRESS are within this subnet.
DOCKER_NETWORK_SUBNET=172.20.0.0/24


# --- Other Optional Pi-hole Environment Variables ---
# See https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#environment-variables for a full list.
# e.g.,
# TEMPERATUREUNIT=c # c or f
# DNSMASQ_LISTENING=all # Or local, or specific interface
# PIHOLE_DNS_= # Alternative way to set DNS1, DNS2, etc.
# VIRTUAL_HOST=pihole.yourdomain.com # For use with reverse proxies like Traefik
