# Notes:
# - Whitelist sparingly. Only whitelist a domain if you are sure it's safe and necessary.
# - Try to whitelist the most specific domain needed, rather than a broad top-level domain.
# - Check the Query Log in Pi-hole to see exactly which domain is being blocked if a service isn't working.
# - This list is not exhaustive and depends heavily on your personal usage.
